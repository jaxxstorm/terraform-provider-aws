resource/aws_vpc: `cidr_block` value can now either be set explicitly or computed computed via AWS IPAM. When set explicitly, the request proceeds as before. To be computed, config uses IPAM to generate by passing `ipv{4,6}_ipam_pool_id` if the `aws_vpc_ipam_pool` has `allocation_default_netmask_length` set or by specifying both `ipv{4,6}_ipam_pool_id` & `ipv{4,6}_netmask_length` which the vpc backend calls will use to request a cidr that matches the netmask length from the specified ipam pool.
